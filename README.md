# IDS
This Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a Python-based tool designed to monitor network traffic, detect suspicious activities, and alert administrators in real time. It uses Scapy to capture and analyze packets, identifying threats such as malicious IP addresses, unauthorized port access, and harmful payloads.
